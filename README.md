# REDUX EXERCISE
In this exercise, you will build a mood changer app that uses redux to alter the mood of a text emoji, as shown below:

You should use the starter **index.html** boilerplate.

You can use whatever ASCII faces you want. You can find a complete list of options [here](https://www.jemoticons.com/en/). Note that the app starts with a default ASCII face that doesnâ€™t correspond do any of the moods.

Remember that since you are using Redux, **your reducer must be a pure function**. Your actions should include a **payload** with the new face.

For DOM manipulation you can use raw JavaScript or JQuery. Redux has been provided for you in a **script** tag within the starter code.

**Do not build this application using React - this should strictly be done with Redux**
